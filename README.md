# ML_Projects_1

The list of projects is mentioned below. There projets were worked on in a chronological fashion, hence, the initial few projects on the list happen to be starter projects.

0. Titanic Case Study: 
   It is a starter data set for classification problems. The data represents information pertaining to the travelers who went      on the fateful journey on the RMS Titanic on April 1912.
   The analysis seeks to understand what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, the tools of machine learning      are used to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.


1. Digit Recognizer (MNIST): 
   The MNIST is probably the best known image-classification dataset. The MNIST is a large public database comprising about        ~70,000 handwritten digits. The task then is to use machine learning approaches to detect these digits.
  
  
2. IRIS Data Set Classification:
   IRIS is a simple dataset that comprises the sepal and petal dimensions of 3 types of IRIS flowers. The goal is to identify      and predict the subspecies based on the dimensions of the flower. I have this data-set to understand Gradient Descent and      Regularization concepts better


4. Image Color Segmentation:
   This is an interesting take on segmentation. The goal of the project is to create a tool which is able to segment images by    color, and further report the top three colors present in the images along with their densities. Additionally, It also          identifies these colors by their name
   

5. Loan Prediction:
   The task is to predict if a loan will get approved or not based on a set of  11 parameters. The set of parameters include      demographic varibles such as education level, employment and gender.
