# LIST OF PROJECTS
The list of projects is mentioned below. These projects are across classification, clustering and time-series forecasting 

1. Digit Recognizer (MNIST): 
   The MNIST is probably the best known image-classification dataset. The MNIST is a large public database comprising about        ~70,000 handwritten digits. The task then is to use machine learning approaches to detect these digits.
  
  
2. IRIS Data Set Classification:
   IRIS is a simple dataset that comprises the sepal and petal dimensions of 3 types of IRIS flowers. The goal is to identify      and predict the subspecies based on the dimensions of the flower. I have this data-set to understand Gradient Descent and      Regularization concepts better

4. Image Color Segmentation:
   This is an interesting take on segmentation. The goal of the project is to create a tool which is able to segment images by    color, and further report the top three colors present in the images along with their densities. Additionally, It also          identifies these colors by their name
   

5. Loan Prediction:
   The task is to predict if a loan will get approved or not based on a set of  11 parameters. The set of parameters include      demographic varibles such as education level, employment and gender.
   
   
6. Forecasting Atmospheric CO2:
   For this case-study, we are utilizing the CO2 concentrations at the Mauna Lao observatory in Hawaii. The CO2                concentrations are recorded in ppm since the last 1950s (for the last 60+ years).
   
   The goal is to forecast the monthly average CO2 concentration of 2018 and 2019. The CO2 concentrations at Sepetember 2018    and Sepetember 2019 were 405.51ppm and 408.54ppm respectively. So, for these months, we'll see if we are able to get        forecasts that are reasonably accurate.
   

7. Restaurant Visitor Forecasting 
   Being able to predict restaurant visits accuractly is a neat application of forecasting techniques. In this case, we have    the data for visits for a restaurant on a daily basis for 1+ years. From an analytic standpoint, a more nuanced version      of forecasting will be attempted, one which incorporates exogenous variables.

   This data is an adapted version of a recently concluded competition on Kaggle
   
   
8. Movie Reviews (Text Classification) 
   In this example, are utilizing a data-set of about 2000 movie reviews. These reviews are full length reviews that have      been classified as being both positive and negative. 
   
   We were able to buid a model that is able to categorize to 85% accuracy on test data.
   
   
9. Real or Not: Identifying Tweets Pertaining to Public Emergencies Using NLP
